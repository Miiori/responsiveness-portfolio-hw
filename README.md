## <a name="build"></a> Building and Summary
---
The Inital request was to create three webpages to simulate a well put together portfolio using Bootstrap. It was intended for all pages to link to eachother with all elements in addtion to using rows and columns functioning seamlessly. My overall satisfaction is that I'm quite content with the turnout. Though the project itself was challenging I had a very fun time with this specific project!

This particular piece of code was key for the background image. The background captures the body then targets the background to repeat an image which can be found on each page.

```  
            <style>
               body {
               background-image: url('https://www.designbolts.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Grey-Jean-White-Seamless-Patterns-For-Website-Backgrounds.jpg');
            }
            </style>
```

Next, this particular peice of code showcase how the Navbar links seamlessly transition from page to page. It also shows that what page you are currently viewing on the navbar with this particular piece: ```aria-current="page"```
based off of this wee can see that on the code we are viewing the "About me" page or "index.html".
```
   <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html" aria-current="page" href="#">About me</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="contact.html">Contact</a>
              </li>
```
